# My TODO List for the Export Company Website

- [x] Create index.html (Homepage with navigation, company banner, and description) - I did this first
- [x] Create products.html (Products page with 6 dummy products, cards, and search bar) - Added some cool cards
- [x] Create contact.html (Contact form with validation and success message) - People can reach out now
- [x] Create css/style.css (Custom styles for clean UI) - Made it look pretty
- [x] Create js/script.js (JavaScript for search functionality and form handling) - Added search and form stuff
- [x] Test the website by opening index.html in browser - Hopefully it works!
- [x] Change contact form success message to popup in js/script.js
- [x] Test the popup success message on form submit
